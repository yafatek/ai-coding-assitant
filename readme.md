# WebSocket Chat with Coding Agent

This project is a WebSocket-based chat application using **FastAPI** to provide real-time chat functionality. It integrates with a custom **CodingAgent** class to interact with the **Gemini API** for generating code responses based on user input. The project includes robust chat history storage and retrieval using **Redis** as an in-memory data store. It also includes safety filters for content moderation and custom tools for enhanced interactions.

## Features

- **WebSocket Chat Interface**: Enables real-time bi-directional communication with users.
- **Code Generation with Gemini API**: Uses the Gemini API to generate code responses based on user prompts.
- **Chat History Storage**: Stores chat messages and responses in Redis for session persistence.
- **Safety Filters**: Implements customizable safety settings for handling potentially harmful content.
- **Custom Tool Integrations**: Adds functionality with `search_custom_engine` and `scrape_website` tools.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the main application code with the WebSocket endpoint and FastAPI setup.
- **CodingAgent Class**:
  - Manages interactions with the Gemini API.
  - Retrieves chat history from Redis and stores interactions.
  - Configures safety settings for content moderation.
- **Logger**: A custom logger that logs important application events and information, enhancing debugging and traceability.
- **RedisMemory**: Manages conversation history storage using Redis for efficient access.

## How It Works

1. **WebSocket Connection**: When a client connects to `/chat`, a WebSocket connection is established, and a new chat session is created with a unique `chat_id`.
2. **User Message Handling**: When a message is received, itâ€™s stored in Redis and passed to the `CodingAgent`.
3. **AI Response Generation**: The `CodingAgent` sends the user message to the Gemini API to generate a response, which is then sent back to the user.
4. **Memory Management**: The chat history is maintained in Redis for the current session and loaded when required.

## Dependencies

- **FastAPI**: For building the WebSocket server and managing routes.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server to run FastAPI applications.
- **Google Generative AI**: For generating AI responses (Gemini API).
- **Redis**: Used for storing chat history and session management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yafatek/ai-coding-assitant.git
```
```bash
 cd websocket-coding-agent
```
Install the required dependencies:
### Docker:
you need a Docker Desktop to run a Redis Instance
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure environment variables, including the Gemini API key and Redis connection details.

Run the application:

```bash 
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 11203
```
## Usage
Start the server.
Connect to the WebSocket endpoint at /chat.
Send a text message, and the application will respond with AI-generated code from the Gemini API.
